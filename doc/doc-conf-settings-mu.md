# Multisite settings

The super-administrator can decide over all the subsites several options:

In which places besides the home page (pages or posts) is possible to produce the General metadatada.

Which type apply in any child site (Blog, WebSite, Book or Course ).

If the installation will create just second languages educational resources, we can have a specific configuration.

In which places (pages, posts or home page) is possible to produce the Educational metadatada.

Also is possible to select which properties can be created in site-meta (book info in pressbooks) and to be apply in all the pages-posts of the sub-sites. By sharing, the value created in site-meta would be the default value in a new post (if the option is selected after a post is created, the value would be share just if the selected field is empty). By freezing, the values would be block and just sites administrators can write the values in the fields which will be share across the full post created or future created post of the installation.
