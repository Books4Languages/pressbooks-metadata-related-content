# Educational Metadata (LRMI)

The [LRMI specification](http://lrmi.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi_1/) is a collection of classes and properties for markup and description of educational resources. The specification builds on the extensive vocabulary provided by Schema.org and other standards. [LRMI terms](http://lrmi.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi_terms/) not included in schema.org may nevertheless be used to augment and enrich Schema.org markup.
