## Installation and Upgrades

* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

For upgrades, download the las stable version from github, delete from FTP the old plugin and install the new one.

## Dependencies

If we were to try to create our plugin without the use of existing plugin solutions we simply would not exist. There is no sustainable way to develop all the functionality needed for our plugin in a short time frame.

* [Custom Metadata Manager](https://github.com/Automattic/custom-metadata) An easy way to add custom fields to your object types (post, pages, custom post types, users) & to generate option pages. PressBooks users have Custom Metadata Manager integrated in the code. For non PressBooks users, we offer Custom Metadata Manager inside of symbionts folder.

## Integrations

All in one metadata works out of the box with:

* [PressBooks](http://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/) is a book content management system which exports in multiple formats: ebooks, webbooks, print-ready PDF, and various XML flavours. Pressbooks is built on top of WordPress Multisite.

We are focus with the metadata, all the other SEO solutions can be find trough other plugins:

* [The SEO Framework](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/)
* [All in one SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/)
* [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)

Not all the plugins are 100% integrated with All in one metadata, some of them works in the site for an enhancement of the features of the site. From the settings page, you can choose to deactivate some of the JSON-LD schema metadata for some integrated plugins.

* Comming soon
