![Educational metadata](images/specific_metadata_educational.png)

Coins and Dublin Core have just one checkbox (for Site level or Home page activation) but Educational have two checkboxes. One for Site level and the second one for Post level

# Educational Metadata (LRMI)

Is a method to embed educational metadata on the homepage or in the Post (chapter for PressBooks users) by going to its tab checking the checkbox and clicking Save Changes. As before, all metadata related to our homepage can be edited under the Tools tab by selecting Site Metadata (or Book info for PressBooks users) for Site level or in the Post (chapter) for Post level.

The [LRMI specification](http://dublincore.org/dcx/lrmi-terms/1.1) is a collection of classes and properties for markup and description of educational resources. The specification builds on the extensive vocabulary provided by Schema.org and other standards. [LRMI terms](http://dublincore.org/dcx/lrmi-terms/) not included in schema.org may nevertheless be used to augment and enrich Schema.org markup.
